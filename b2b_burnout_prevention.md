Business idea:

Software that can predict + educate businesses on risk and prevention of burnout for employees.

### Problem

Busines

In NL, when an employee goes into sick leave, you pay them their salary while they are gone. The employee can be on sick leave up to 2 years. This is potentially 2 years of wages without the employee returning to work. It is high cost for a business to have employees who are burnt out. A bad workplace has rippling impacts on team morale, company reputation, and employee health.

Employee

A toxic work environment, with bad leadership and not enough capacity can lead to burnout or other mental health issues. Can eventually lead to the necessity to take sick leave to recover.

### Proposal

If the signs of a high burnout risk workplace are identified, and company leadership is open to change to address the issues, it could prevent employees needing to take sick leave because of mental health issues caused by their negative work environment.

### Unknowns

Is there research done on signs of burnout or toxic workplace? Is it possible to predict when the workplace can cause mental health issues? 

Assumption that its a workplace issue that causes burnout, but it may be many other factors. Do companies know the cause for sick leave? Does the arboarts educate company on mitigating risk of burnout for the employee?
