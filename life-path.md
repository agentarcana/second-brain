## Things that I like doing

- Public speaking
- writing about my ideas, emotions, and observations.
- learning new things.
- understanding a hard technical concept (i.e feeling like a nerd).

- helping someone shift their perspective or think differently about an issue they are facing.

#### product manager career

Making decisions, asking questions, building relationships with people, learning to understand the problems and possible solutions, viability into data.

Challenges:

Hard to measure performance. Am I good at my job or not? Have I succeeded? Don't get instant validation or feedback. How do I know if I have made a positive impact or any impact at all?

#### youtuber / content creator

has autonomy and creativity. no feedback on impact in the beginning. 

then, once you do get feedback, its from viewers. should that feedback change the content you make? problem solving at scale.. requires a deep understanding of the problem. and the reality that the solution cannot work for everyone.

the money/rewards are also tied to feedback. and there is no nuance. the data is incomplete. 

risky to problem solve on incomplete data. 

risky to measure success and satisfaction on scaled feedback. will have to be very clear about who's feedback matters and who's doesn't.

or who's feedback you're looking for. who's problem you're solving for. or what problem you're solving for.

### career review

### music teacher

A job that gave me immense energy. 

Elements:

* a use for being able to see potential in people.
* the puzzle of finding suitable tools and path to help them see the potential I see. Like choosing their songs or performance pieces with the goal of developing certain skills and beliefs.
* the instant feedback of progress. Like them reaching the note or not. How do they feel and talk about themselves. What energy do they have.
* Having the satisfaction of seeing them succeed.
* the fulfilment of using my gifts to amplify theirs. 
* the connection and trust that I get from the student. That they trust me even if they don't trust themselves yet.
* The autonomy to experiment and determine the path with the student. i.e no manager telling me I can't or that my plan isn't allowed/wanted/valuable.
* The power of being a teacher. Of having influence on someone's self-perception. The power to contribute to someone's change and growth.
* Every hour was a new challenge, a new problem, a new student, a new dynamic. It required different solutions, different skills, different plans, different versions of me to show up.
* The students I felt most alive with were those who i could see clearly. Who resonated with parts in me. Who reminded me of myself. Those who were confident and self-assured scared me because I didn't understand what they needed. And I didn't know what I could offer them.

### support agent / sysadmin skills

* constant learning
* instant feedback - problem solved or not, customer happy or not.
* some autonomy, i was allowed to rabbit hole because of protection by mentor
* feeling of growth and improvement in my own skills.
* some impact/influence. team was receptive to my ideas.
* new and interesting problems. able to choose some of the problems with the tickets I take.
* performance measured by subjective quality, but also quantity (created friction)

### QA

* no autonomy or ownership.
* no sense of agency or feeling like my opinion matters or is valued.
* no meaningful impact
