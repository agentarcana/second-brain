#### product manager career

Making decisions, asking questions, building relationships with people, learning to understand the problems and possible solutions, viability into data.

Challenges:

Hard to measure performance. Am I good at my job or not? Have I succeeded? Don't get instant validation or feedback. How do I know if I have made a positive impact or any impact at all?

### career review

### music teacher

A job that gave me immense energy. 

Elements:

* a use for being able to see potential in people.
* the puzzle of finding suitable tools and path to help them see the potential I see. Like choosing their songs or performance pieces with the goal of developing certain skills and beliefs.
* the instant feedback of progress. Like them reaching the note or not. How do they feel and talk about themselves. What energy do they have.
* Having the satisfaction of seeing them succeed.
* the fulfilment of using my gifts to amplify theirs. 
* the connection and trust that I get from the student. That they trust me even if they don't trust themselves yet.
* The autonomy to experiment and determine the path with the student. i.e no manager telling me I can't or that my plan isn't allowed/wanted/valuable.
* The power of being a teacher. Of having influence on someone's self-perception. The power to contribute to someone's change and growth.
* Every hour was a new challenge, a new problem, a new student, a new dynamic. It required different solutions, different skills, different plans, different versions of me to show up.
* The students I felt most alive with were those who i could see clearly. Who resonated with parts in me. Who reminded me of myself. Those who were confident and self-assured scared me because I didn't understand what they needed. And I didn't know what I could offer them.

### support agent / sysadmin skills

* constant learning
* instant feedback - problem solved or not, customer happy or not.
* some autonomy, i was allowed to rabbit hole because of protection by mentor
* feeling of growth and improvement in my own skills.
* some impact/influence. team was receptive to my ideas.
* new and interesting problems. able to choose some of the problems with the tickets I take.
* performance measured by subjective quality, but also quantity (created friction)

### QA

* no autonomy or ownership.
* no sense of agency or feeling like my opinion matters or is valued.
* no meaningful impact
