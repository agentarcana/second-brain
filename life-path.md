Making decisions, asking questions, building relationships with people, learning to understand the problems and possible solutions, viability into data.

Challenges:

Hard to measure performance. Am I good at my job or not? Have I succeeded? Don't get instant validation or feedback. How do I know if I have made a positive impact or any impact at all?
