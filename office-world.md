An idea for software:

Its like Slack, Zoom, Jira, and GitHub all in one, but the UI is like a world in a game (like Skyrim, the Sims, Warcraft). 

You run the business in this world. Each world has the following spaces:

* Map view of the world (you can see who is present in which space currently)
* Town Square (where everyone can gather and start convos?)
* Canteen (for specific topics by table? you join a table and can see what was talked about previously and then join a conversation synchronously or read transcripts??)
* Core/Control panel (where access and security is managed)
* council room (where company mission/goals/quests are drafted and discussed and stored)
* library (like a company handbook, but designed as library with an AI librarian to answer questions)
* Town Hall/auditorium (fits whole company and is for full company gatherings and announcements. Has advanced presentation functionality)
* Team rooms - each team designs their own room. They can mute themselves, or they can just start talking over mic when they're in the room and anyone can hear them. like you would do in a game or on discord. The team room should have functionality that is specific for that team and has features that the team will need. Like marketing team has access to lead data, social media posts, etc.
* Personal space / character creation (where you can tweak your avatar, read and set quests and assignments, book PTO, manage your work or calendar, look at your skillstree and XP)
* Thanks room/ Hall of Celebrations - if someone thanks you or celebrates your accomplishment, this is saved in the hall for a period of time, but it also automatically saves to your personal space so that you can track it as part of your personal development/goals/achievements.
* Lobby - a minimalist "waiting room" for people who don't have access to the inside of the business, like for customers who are waiting to start a meeting with someone. The lobby is the face of the business for the outside world.

Notifications: pop up to alert you of meetings "Meeting with Bob starts in 5 mins in x room." Button: go to x room

AI employees:
* Librarian/scribe/documentarian/archivist - they can be invited to any meeting to document/note take and then they store/archive the meeting notes in the archive/library for future reference. Anytime you need something that was documented, you can look in the archives or you can ask the librarian. They can also help document things with employees, like if they need help documenting a new feature, or drawing up new architecture diagrams.
