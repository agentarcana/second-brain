# Pumpkin fritters

Hahaha fair — no one wants a savoury impostor when the heart is calling for cinnamon-sugar bliss.

You’re talking about the real deal South African pampoenkoekies — golden, soft, slightly crisp on the outside, melt-in-the-mouth inside, and showered in cinnamon sugar. The kind your gran would make on a Sunday and you’d burn your fingers trying to grab the first one.

Let’s get to your questions 👇

🇿🇦 So, who actually “owns” pumpkin fritters?

They’re deeply South African, though like much of South African cuisine, their roots are a mix of Dutch settler (Cape Dutch) and Indigenous/Malay influences.
	•	The Dutch settlers brought recipes for simple flour-egg-pumpkin fritters (koekies, poffertjes, oliebollen).
	•	Local cooks added spice (cinnamon, nutmeg) and sugar syrup or dusting, transforming them into something distinctly Cape-style.
	•	Over time, they became a Boerekos (Afrikaner home cooking) classic — but they’re really a fusion dish, born at the Cape.

So: not truly Dutch anymore — the Netherlands has nothing like them today — but originally inspired by old Dutch desserts that evolved under African sun and hands.

🧡 Your kabocha squash is perfect for pampoenkoekies

It’s even better than standard pumpkin because it’s:
	•	naturally sweeter,
	•	less watery, and
	•	gives that dense, custardy interior that holds together beautifully.

🍮 The Proper Comfort-Food Recipe

(Traditional SA style, not the “healthy” version 😌)

Ingredients
	•	2 cups mashed, cooked kabocha (roasted or steamed until soft)
	•	1 cup flour
	•	2 tsp baking powder
	•	2 Tbsp sugar (plus extra for coating)
	•	1 egg
	•	Pinch of salt
	•	1 tsp cinnamon (optional in the batter)
	•	Oil for frying

To serve
	•	Mix ½ cup sugar + 2 tsp cinnamon for dusting

Method
	1.	Mash the pumpkin while warm — smooth but not watery. If it’s too wet, strain or cook off moisture in a pan.
	2.	Mix in the egg, sugar, and salt.
	3.	Stir in flour and baking powder until you get a thick batter (like drop-scone consistency).
	4.	Heat oil in a pan (medium heat, enough to shallow fry).
	5.	Drop spoonfuls in and fry until golden on both sides.
	6.	Drain briefly on paper towel, then immediately coat in cinnamon sugar while still hot.

Serve warm. Eat with fingers. Burn tongue. Regret nothing.
