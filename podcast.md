Perplexity answer:

For recording audio on a MacBook with your microphone, several excellent software options exist—ranging from free beginner tools to professional-grade studio applications.[3][5][6][7]

### Free and Beginner-Friendly Options

- **GarageBand** (pre-installed on macOS): Ideal for solo or simple podcast recordings. It supports high-quality multitrack recording, basic editing (cut, trim, EQ), and exporting finished podcasts. It’s integrated with Apple’s ecosystem and works smoothly on Mac and iPhone.[5][6][3]
- **Audacity**: A free, open-source platform for recording and editing high-quality audio (up to 32-bit float depth). It’s more advanced than GarageBand but has a steeper learning curve and lacks remote guest recording features.[3]
- **QuickTime Player**: Built into every Mac, QuickTime can record simple voice audio (File → New Audio Recording). It’s easy for basic solo episodes or drafts, though it lacks editing tools.[14][16]

### Intermediate to Professional Tools

- **Riverside.fm**: A browser-based studio for recording studio-quality audio and 4K video, perfect for interview-style podcasts. Each participant’s audio is locally recorded for clarity and can be edited in the same interface.[4][5]
- **RØDE Connect**: Designed for use with RØDE USB microphones, it allows multitrack recording, real-time mixing, and integration with live streaming or remote interviews.[13]
- **Logic Pro**: Apple’s professional Digital Audio Workstation for high-quality multitrack recording and precise editing, compatible with GarageBand projects for seamless upgrading.[11][3]
- **Hindenburg Pro**: Specialized for podcasters and journalists. It includes AI-powered audio leveling, noise reduction, and direct publishing features.[3]
- **ProTools**: Industry-standard recording software offering powerful editing and mastering features, though it’s expensive and has a steeper learning curve.[6]

### Recommendations by Goal

| Goal | Best Software | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Simple solo podcast | GarageBand or QuickTime | Free and native for Mac |
| Interview or remote podcast | Riverside.fm or RØDE Connect | High-quality local + remote recording |
| Professional production | Logic Pro or Hindenburg Pro | Detailed editing and publishing tools |
| Open-source and advanced | Audacity | Full control but basic UI |

For your setup (MacBook + microphone), **GarageBand** is the easiest starting point, **Riverside.fm** is best for remote guests, and **Logic Pro** offers the greatest upgrade path once you’re ready for more advanced audio work.
