## Storage management

Recommendation for Past Footage Storage
For storing past footage (archives you won't be actively editing from every day), an External HDD is the recommended choice due to the significantly lower cost per gigabyte and high capacity.

Look for a Desktop-class HDD (often 3.5-inch with a separate power cord) for the best value and capacity (e.g., 8TB, 12TB, or more).

Portable HDDs (2.5-inch, USB-powered) are also an option for smaller archives (up to 5TB) and more portability, but they will be slightly slower.

🚀 Recommendation for Active Editing (Optional)
If you plan to sometimes edit older 4K footage directly from the drive, you should consider a fast External Portable SSD. The speed difference is substantial, allowing for smoother timeline scrubbing and faster rendering.

Popular choices often mentioned by creators include the Samsung T7 Shield/T7, SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD V2, or LaCie Rugged SSD.

🔑 Key Features to Look For
Since your footage is from an iPhone and Sony camera, you are likely dealing with high-resolution files (4K or higher). Here's what matters most:

Connection Type:

Since you use a MacBook, look for drives with USB-C or Thunderbolt 3/4 connections. This ensures the fastest possible transfer from your computer. Many drives will include a USB-C to USB-C cable or an adapter.

Reliability & Brand:

Stick to established brands known for reliable storage, such as Seagate (often with LaCie rugged options), Western Digital (WD), and SanDisk Professional (G-Technology).

Capacity:

Video files consume space quickly. For archival, aim for the largest capacity you can afford (e.g., 4TB or more for an HDD).

💡 Pro Tip: The 3-2-1 Backup Strategy
No single hard drive is infallible. For essential, irreplaceable footage, it's highly recommended to use the 3-2-1 Backup Rule:

3 copies of your data (the original files on your computer/SD card + two backups).

2 different types of media (e.g., an external HDD and an SSD, or two separate HDDs).

1 offsite copy (e.g., a cloud service or a physical drive stored at a different location).

### SSD vs HDD

| Feature | Solid State Drive (SSD) | Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed (Read/Write) | Very Fast (500 MB/s to 2800+ MB/s) | Slower (100 MB/s to 250 MB/s)
| Cost per Terabyte | Higher | Lower (Better for high capacity) |
| Best For | "Active editing, transferring data quickly, on-the-go work, project drives." | "Long-term storage, archiving, backups, and very large video libraries." |
| Durability | "More durable (no moving parts), better for travel." | "Less durable (has spinning platters), better for stationary use." |
| Common Capacities | Portable: 500GB to 4TB | Portable: 1TB to 5TB; Desktop: 4TB to 20TB+ |

### Harddrive format: Compatibility Mac vs Windows

This is the most critical factor when using one drive with both a Mac and a Windows PC. The issue lies in the File System Format.

1. The Compatibility Problem
By default, Mac and Windows use different file systems that don't fully work together:

Mac Default (APFS/HFS+): Windows can usually read these drives with third-party software (like MacDrive), but cannot write to them natively.

Windows Default (NTFS): Mac can usually read these drives, but cannot write to them natively without installing third-party software (which can be unreliable).

2. The Solution: Format to exFAT
To ensure you can read and write files on the same drive from both your MacBook and your Windows PC, you must format the drive using the exFAT file system.

What is exFAT? It is a file system designed by Microsoft specifically for flash drives and external media that has full read/write support on both Windows and Mac operating systems.

Why exFAT? Crucially for content creators, exFAT does not have the 4GB file size limit that the older FAT32 format had, allowing you to transfer those massive video files from your Sony camera or iPhone without issue.

✅ Summary of What to Do
Buy the Drive: Choose a drive (e.g., WD My Book, Seagate Expansion, or LaCie d2/Mobile Drive) with a USB-C connection.

Check the Current Format: Many drives sold today are pre-formatted for Mac (HFS+ or APFS) or Windows (NTFS).

Reformat the Drive: Immediately connect the drive to either your Mac or PC and use the native Disk Utility (Mac) or Disk Management (Windows) to reformat the entire drive to exFAT.

Once formatted to exFAT, your drive will be fully compatible with both your MacBook and any Windows PC, making the archival process seamless
