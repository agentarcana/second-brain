A running list of ideas for software that I want to see exist in the world.

### Feature storefront / landing page

Like Amazon store pages - its a landing page for aoftware features where PM crafts their vision for the feature.

Pain point addressed: non-feature team members have to sift through list of tickets/issues to find feature requests, bugs, and roadmap or plans for future changes to the feature.

The storefront is a landing page that can include roadmap, OKRs, vision, priorities, designs, etc.

This should have a more polished look and have visualisation capabilities - easy to make charts, annotate on designs or pictures, add videos, add team info. Like a dashboard/page builder with widgets.
