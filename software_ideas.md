A running list of ideas for software that I want to see exist in the world.

### Personal app

Like a knowledge base for your life. Documentation for things that work and don't work, that make you feel good and you want to do more of or things that don't.

Like a personal user manual. 

Health:
How much sleep do you need? Which foods make you bloated? What kind of content makes your mental health worse or better?

Values:
Which values drive your life and act as the compass? Which behaviours line up with that? which values attract you, which repel you. what kind of person do you want to be?

What kind of gifts do you like? what are your love languages? personality types? map out the woowoo! 

Connections:
like a CRM for your friends. log their details, and the stuff you want to remember about them. log their birthday and cool memories.

### Feature storefront / landing page

Like Amazon store pages - its a landing page for aoftware features where PM crafts their vision for the feature.

Pain point addressed: non-feature team members have to sift through list of tickets/issues to find feature requests, bugs, and roadmap or plans for future changes to the feature.

The storefront is a landing page that can include roadmap, OKRs, vision, priorities, designs, etc.

This should have a more polished look and have visualisation capabilities - easy to make charts, annotate on designs or pictures, add videos, add team info. Like a dashboard/page builder with widgets.

### An app for diagnosis / birth defect tracking

Use case 1: Cancer diagnosis
Use case 2: Child born with cleft lip

Core features: 

Log photos, test results, x-rays, and personal details about the patients condition for easy record keeping of their own medical history. 

Specialized educational platform - 

This should be the place where in depth, vetted, and researched information on the condition can be found. The information should include (and distinguish between) the most well-known info to the newest research and findings on the condition.
The patient should be able to ask questions about their condition and be able to understand the details withoit needing a medical degree. A specialized AI component here may be useful.  

Almost like a pregnancy tracker - 

It shows general info of what can be expected with this condition and the options.

For cleft lip, it outlines the general journey for the procedures, surgeries, and orthodontic intervention needed at which stage and age of the person's life.

Social aspect -

Connecting with other patients who are on the same journey and being able to build a community for support and information sharing. Should be global.
