Your score on the Director scale is 27 out of a possible 42, or 64%.
Your score on the Negotiator scale is 32 out of a possible 42, or 76%.


Your Primary personality Type is Negotiator.
NEGOTIATORS are philosophers. These women (and men) express traits linked with the estrogen system in the brain. These people see the big picture. They are imaginative and intuitive. They have superb language and people skills. They are also emotionally expressive, as well as agreeable, trusting and compassionate. Negotiators seek someone with whom they can make an intensely intimate, deeply meaningful, inspiring and spiritual connection. But Negotiators, like Directors, prefer to go out with one person at a time and to explore the depths of this potential partnership. They dislike wasting time on irrelevant, trivial or boring socializing. When they find “The One,” Negotiators are superb at generating and maintaining intimacy with this partner. They avoid conflicts with a mate, and make major personal adjustments to strengthen this cherished bond. They give thoughtful gifts, such as a treasured book or photograph. They share their most personal feelings. And they want their partner to share his or her feelings too.

Negotiators are often attracted to their opposite, Directors.

Here are some famous Negotiators:


Bill Clinton
Contextual web thinking:
“I think it is important to have a synthesizing mind.”
Language skills / people skills
Emotionally expressive
Compassionate: “I feel your pain.”


Oprah Winfrey
Sees the big picture: “web thinking”
Verbal & people skills
Intuitive: “The only time I have made a bad decision is when I didn’t follow my instinct.”
Compassionate: “Your company is dysfunctional and your employees are entitled”
Emotionally expressive
Educator / reader


Your Secondary personality type is Director.
DIRECTORS shoot for the stars. These men (and women) express traits linked with the testosterone system in the brain. They tend to excel at analytical and strategic thinking. They are also direct, decisive, exacting and tough minded. Directors are good at what scientists call “rule-based systems,” aptitudes such as higher math, mechanics, computers, engineering and/or music. And they are often competitive, as well as skeptical and emotionally contained. Directors approach dating and relationships the same way they approach their other interests, by rationally analyzing their hopes, needs and intentions. Foremost they seek a partner who shares their goals, as well as someone who is eager to exchange ideas, build theories and talk about science, philosophy, history or whatever interests them. To balance out their forthright style and tendency to make decisions quickly, Directors tend to gravitate to partners who weigh alternatives, listen actively, handle conflicts deftly and have other well-honed social skills. Because they analyze their own emotions, as well as hide them, Directors tend to seek mates who are emotionally expressive. Because they have difficulty dealing with “controlling” people, they tend to be attracted to those who are flexible, even indecisive. Thus they often gravitate to Negotiators who have the empathy and emotional complexity to handle their forceful personalities.

Among Directors, opposites attract, like Negotiators.

Here are some famous Directors:


Steve Jobs
"the Svengali of the digital revolution" “Brash,” “mercurial,” “notoriously prickly,” “fiercely demanding,” “brutally honest.”


Hillary Clinton
Direct, Decisive, Tough-minded.
Considered joining US Marines in 1975
First woman partner at her law firm
First female senator, New York

You are not likely to express all of the traits associated with these two brain systems. But you express more of these traits than those linked with the other two brain systems. Hence these are your primary and secondary types.
