## emotional rescuer

recognising how you are trying to control someone else's experience. 
allowing others to have feelings.
allowing the discomfort within yourself.
what does it mean to hold space for someone? how to allow someone to be in discomfort without saving them.
how to make it safe for whatever needs to be there to be there? how to create a container?

## depression antidote

feeling your feelings
yoga
breathwork
recognising that depression is when you have suppressed emotion. when you have not allowed yourself to feel something. possibly when your boundaries have been crossed and there was no reparations.

## anxiety

anxiety is the shaking lid on a pot of boiling water. its trying to contain a lot.

you can lift the lid and let the pressure out. or you can turn down the heat. or remove the pot from the flame.
